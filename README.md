# JSON Server Template 
This repo can be used as a basic structure for creating json server repositories.

## Seed Data

update the db/seeds.json file to contain your starting data in json format: an object with a key pointing to an array. See the example data already in the db/seeds.json file for a template of how your data should be structured.

To copy data from db/seeds.json to the db.json file, run:
$ npm run seed

$ npm run seed can be run any time you want to overwrite your data back mto the seeded data. 

## Run the server locally
